# plugins

gulp is made of plugins, each serving different purposes:

- `ingestion` plugins for ingesting data from local sources (i.e. log files)
- `external` plugins to query external sources (i.e. a SIEM), and possibly ingest data into gulp at the same time
- `extension` plugins to extend the gulp [REST api](../src/gulp/api/rest/)
  
currently, we have the following plugins:

## plugin types

gulp support different plugin types, even if they share all [the same architecture](../src/gulp/plugin.py).

### ingestion

- Apache's standard `access.log` and `error.log`
- Windows `evtx`
- Windows `registry` hives
- Systemd `journal` files
- A few of the Zimmerman tools' output files
- A few Autopsy exports files
- Chrome `history` and `webdata` db files
- Network capture `pcap` and `pcapng` files
- Email message boxes using `mbox` and plain `eml` files
- Teamviewer's `connection_incoming.txt`

Along side the specific ones we also provide some generic "base" plugins which can be used as a base to build your own plugins!

- Generic `sqlite` databases
- Generic single-line text files via the `regex` plugin
- Generic `csv` files

### external

- `elasticsearch` to query and ingest from an external source based on `Elasticsearch` or `Opensearch` (i.e. Wazuh)

### extension

- use [`example`](../src/gulp/plugins/extension/example.py) plugin as a base, currently we have extension plugins (i.e. support for `OAUTH` login) on our paid offer only.

### enrichment

- [enrich_whois](../src/gulp/plugins/enrich_whois.py) to enrich one or more documents with whois information
- ...

# architecture

While plugins can be as complex as needed, a basic plugin **must** implement the functions:

- `display_name`: returns the display name of the plugin
- `type`: may be `ingestion`, `extension`, `external`
- `_record_to_gulp_document`: this is called automatically by the engine on each record in the source being processed

then depending on `type`, different entrypoints may be implemented:

- `ingest_file`: implemented in `ingestion` plugins, this is the entrypoint to ingest a file.
  - look in [win_evtx](../src/gulp/plugins/win_evtx.py) for a complete example.
  
- `ingest_raw`: implemented in `ingestion` plugins, this is basically as `_ingest_file` but allows to ingest raw pre-generated `GulpDocuments`
  - this is currently used only by the [raw](../src/gulp/plugins/raw.py) plugin.
  
- `sigma_support`: lists the [pysigma](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma) backends and pipelines the plugin supports, to support sigma rules conversion into queries for different targets.
  - these are returned by the `plugin_list` API.
  - the plugin must implement the `backends` and `pipelines` listed, which are to be used through `sigma_convert` entrypoint.
  
- `sigma_convert`: implements the actual sigma rule conversion using the selected pysigma `backend`, `pipeline`, `output_format` from `GulpQuerySigmaParameters`.
  - look in [win_evtx](../src/gulp/plugins/win_evtx.py) for implementation (it supports converting windows sigma rules to gulp queries)

- `query_external`: implemented by `external` plugins, queries (and possibly ingest from, at the same time) an external source.
  - look in [elasticsearch](../src/gulp/plugins/elasticsearch.py) for a complete example.
  - `GulpQueryExternalParameters` holds parameters to query the external source, plus the `plugin` and `GulpPluginParameters` to be used.

other optional entrypoints are:

- `custom_parameters`: returned by the `plugin_list` API, this defines each custom parameter the plugin support and may be used by the UI to build a configurator for the plugin.
  - they are available in each plugin after initialization via `self._custom_params`.
  - they are passed in the `GulpPluginParameters.custom_parameters` dict as additional keys.
  
- `tags`: returned by the `plugin_list` API, defines tags to categorize the plugin
- `version`: the plugin version string
- `desc`: the plugin description
- `depends_on`: if the plugin dependens on other plugins, they are listed here.

## plugin internals

the base class [GulpPluginBase](../src/gulp/plugin.py) handles most of the complex orchestration while the plugin focuses on the external source specific implementations.

the base class provides:

- Document buffering and batch processing
- Websocket streaming
- Ingestion into Gulp's Opensearch
- Statistics tracking
- Mapping file handling

the plugins must implement:

- for `ingestion` plugins:
  - format parser to extract single records.
- for `external` plugins:
  - the logic to connect to the external server.
  - query conversion
  - record format conversion
- for `enrichment` plugins:
  - the logic to enrich a set of documents
- for `extension` plugins, they may install additional `API routes` during gulp initialization.

> optionally, both `ingestion` and `external` plugins may implement `sigma_convert` and `sigma_support` to allow the `query` api to convert `sigma rules` to gulp queries for both local and external queries.
>
> - read [pysigma documentation](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/pySigma) to learn more about backend/s and pipeline/s!

### ingestion plugins

ingestion plugins must implement `ingest_file` and/or `ingest_raw` (the ingestion entrypoints).

> optionally, `ingestion` plugins may implement `_enrich_documents_chunk` to perform enrichment before storing the chunk to Opensearch.

this is how the data flows through an `ingestion plugin` when ingesting into gulp through `ingest_file` API.

### enrichment plugins

enrichment plugins takes one or more `GulpDocuments` and returns them augmented with extra data.

they must implement `enrich_documents`, `enrich_single_documents` and `_enrich_documents_chunk`.

> a plugin may support both `enrichment` and `ingestion` by declaring its `type` as `[GulpPluginType.INGESTION, GulpPluginType.ENRICH]` and implement both types entrypoints.

a preliminary example is [here](../src/gulp/plugins/enrich_example.py).

## mapping files

`ingestion` and `external` plugins both support mapping files through [GulpPluginParameters](../src/gulp/structs.py) and [GulpQueryParameters.external_parameters.plugin_params](../src/gulp/api/opensearch/structs.py), to customize both ingested documents and/or documents returned from an `external` query.

mapping files may be used standalone (i.e. with the `csv` plugin without having another plugin) or together with an existing one by setting parameters when the plugin calls `_initialize`.

a mapping file basically instructs an existing plugin how to parse fields from the log, using a simplified `json` stucture.

while making mappings, try to adhere to one of the following conventions (ordered from most to least preferred):

  1. `ECS` standard defined by elastic [here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/ecs/current/index.html)
  2. `gulp.<meaningful_name>.*` such as `gulp.http.query.params.<name>` or `gulp.pcap.<protocol>.field`
  3. anything else

remember, the more standardized the logs we collect are, the easier it will be to create and share detection rules and query snippets!

> [Mapping files](../src/gulp/mapping_files/) are extremely useful when using a base plugin such as the `csv`, `sqlite` or `regex` plugins.

### example

Here's a commented example, further details in the [model definition source](../src/gulp/api/mapping/models.py)

```json
{    
  "metadata": {
    // lists the plugins this mapping file supports: this allows the UI to correlate plugins and mapping files via the `mapping_file_list` API
    "plugin": [
      "sqlite.py"
    ]
  },
  // one or more supported mappings, each key is a `mapping_id`
  "mappings": {
    // the `mapping_id`
    "autofill": {
      // optional: if set, sets `event.code` for all(*) the documents generated by this mapping. either, it is plugin responsibility to set it.
      // (*): this is ignored for extra documents generated with `extra_doc_with_event_code`, as explained later.
      "event_code": "autofill_date_created",
      // optional: if set, sets `agent.type` for all the documents generated by this mapping. either, it is plugin responsibility to set it.
      "agent_type": "chromium",
      // optional: if set, matching fields in the source document are ignored and not included in the generated document/s.      
      "exclude": ["field1", "field2"],
      // optional: if set, only matching fields in the source document are processed and included in the generated document/s.      
      "include": ["field1", "field2"],
      // the following are advanced options to control how timestamp strings are handled by the gulp's engine, and their usage should be rarely needed.
      //
      // anyway, they map 1:1 to options in python's [dateutil.parser.parse](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/parser.html).
      "timestamp_dayfirst": null, // defaults to False
      "timestamp_yearfirst": null, // defaults to False
      "timestamp_fuzzy": null, // defaults to False
      // the fields to map: source fields not listed here will be stored with `gulp.unmapped.` prefix.
      "fields": {
        // the field name
        "name": {
          // this may be a string or a []: this allows mapping a single field to one or more target document fields.
          "ecs": "gulp.html.form.field.name"
        },
        "value": {
          "ecs": "gulp.html.form.field.value"
        },
        "date_created": {
          // since in gulp every document needs at least a "@timestamp", either it is mapped here to a field or it is the responsibility of the plugin to set it.
          // the engine, with the plugin's cooperation if needed, will take care of the necessary conversion ("@timestamp" is stored as an ISO-8601 string) and also generates `gulp.timestamp` as `nanoseconds from unix epoch`.
          "ecs": "@timestamp",
          // this is a special flag to indicate the **original** timestamp (prior to gulp's processing) is an int or a numeric string and needs to be multiplied: this may also be a fraction (i.e. 0.5) to indicate division.
          "multiplier": 1000000000
        },
        "a_chrome_timestamp": {
          "ecs": "chrome_ts",
          // this is a special flag to indicate the **original** timestamp (prior to gulp's processing) is a `webkit` timestamp from 1601, so gulp will perform the necessary conversions.
          "is_timestamp_chrome": true
        },        
        "date_last_used": {
          // if this is set, this field represents a timestamp and a further document will be generated alongside the `main` document.
          // 
          // in this example, in the extra document the following will be set:
          //
          // - "@timestamp" will be set to this "date_last_used" value (flags like `multiplier` or `is_timestamp_chrome` are processed as well, if set)
          // - "event.code" will be set to "autofill_date_last_used" (so the mapping's `event_code` flag above is ignored here)
          //
          // for this to work, one main timestamp must be selected as the main and mapped as "@timestamp", i.e.
          // 
          // "field_name": {
          //    "ecs": "@timestamp"
          // }
          //
          // and mapping's "event_code" must be set to indicate the main `event.code`.
          //
          // setting `extra_doc_with_event_code` for multiple fields allows to generate multiple documents from a single source (i.e. if an event has multiple timestamp like `creation_time`, `modify_time`, ...)
          //
          "extra_doc_with_event_code": "autofill_date_last_used",
          "multiplier": 1000000000
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## stacked plugins

plugins may be stacked one on top of the another, as a `lower` and `higher` plugin: the idea is the `higher` plugin has access to the data processed by `lower` and can `enrich` it.

Stacked plugins are usually based on generic python *ingestion* plugins such as `csv`, `sqlite`.

An example of a basic extension plugin is [stacked_example](../src/gulp/plugins/stacked_example.py), or for a real one you may look at [chrome_history](../src/gulp/plugins/chrome_history_sqlite_stacked.py) which sits on top of the [sqlite](../src/gulp/plugins/sqlite.py) plugin.

### flow

stacking is handled by the engine, which basically does this `for every record` being processed in the source document:

- calls plugin's own `_record_to_gulp_document`
- if there is a plugin stacked on top, calls its `_record_to_gulp_document` with the `GulpDocument` returned as `dict`.
- if the stacked plugin also implements `_enrich_documents_chunk`, this is called with each chunk of documents`right before` storing into gulp.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A(Log file) -->|parsed by| B[Base plugin]
    B --> |Generates GulpDocument| C[Stacked plugin]
    C --> |Modifies GulpDocument.model_dump| D(Ingest events)
```

so, basically, as every other plugin they must implement `_record_to_gulp_document`, but instead of a `GulpDocument` object they receives (and returns) `record` as its `dict` representation: here they can postprocess the record (i.e. change/add/delete fields).

- they must call `setup_stacked_plugin(lower_plugin)` in their `ingest_file`, `ingest_raw`, `query_external` entrypoints (depending on where it is needed)

- some plugins may want to bypass the engine and call lower's `_record_to_gulp_document` by itself: so, they must use `load_plugin` instead of `setup_stacked_pugin` in their initialization: for an example of this, look at the [mbox](../src/gulp/plugins/mbox.py) which sits on top of the [eml](../src/gulp/plugins/eml.py) plugin.

## extension plugins

extensions plugins starts with gulp and mostly runs **in the main process context**, even if it is supported to spwan them across worker processes.

they may be used to extend gulp API, i.e. implement new sign-in code, ...

# addendum: query using sigma rules

a sigma rule must be converted to the target DSL first, i.e. to query gulp with sigma rules we need OpenSearch pysigma backend support.

querying through sigma rules is fully supported both for gulp and `external` sources.

> queries using standard query follows the same path, just `query_gulp`, `query_raw`, `query_stored` API is used instead.

## gulp

we must setup [GulpQueryParameters.sigma_parameters.plugin](../src/gulp/api/opensearch/structs.py) to the plugin implementing `sigma_convert` for an OpenSearch backend, for example the [win_evtx](../src/gulp/plugins/win_evtx.py) plugin implements windows-specific sigma rules conversion for OpenSearch backend.

- look at [test_win_evtx](../tests/query.py) in the query tests for an example

## external plugins

to query an external plugin, we must fill the needed parameters (i.e. `username`, `password`, `uri`, `plugin`) in [GulpQueryParameters.external_parameters](../src/gulp/api/opensearch/structs.py) as well as [GulpQueryParameters.sigma_parameters.plugin](../src/gulp/api/opensearch/structs.py) to indicate the plugin used to perform the conversion (which may be the same as the one used for querying).

- look at [test_elasticsearch](../tests/query.py) in the query tests for an example
